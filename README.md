>**A container to easily make discord bot!**

For beginners in discord.js, just focus on command, not on the login, the prefix, args etc ... ContainScord do the rest ! For people how knows more about discord.js you don't have to write an endless if/else statement and you will clearly see all commands and events.

## Why?

Because... No, seriously at the beginning I made this container for me because I don't want to recod everything for each bot that I create. That really helps me and I think someone can also find this helpful... so I share this!

## Installation _(for windows)_

To install the bot you need node.js 6.0.0 or newer. Clone or download this repository then open a cmd with shift+rightclick -> open command windows here. In the cmd type `npm install` to install dependencies. Configure config.json (add yout token put your prefix etc...). When your okay type `npm start` use the link to invite the bot to your server and...
The bot is launched !!! Now you need to code the commands and the event or grab them...

## Creating a command
